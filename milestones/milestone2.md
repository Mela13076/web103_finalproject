## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Agreed on design decisions quickly and were able to split the work efficiently.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Scheduling a time for a meeting was hard because both of our schedules were stacked due to midterms and other obligations.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We may need assistance with implementing the relationships in our ER model, especially the harder ones such as the many-to-many link between tasks and categories.
